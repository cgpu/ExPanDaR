Description: Provides a shiny-based front end (the 'ExPanD' app) and
    a set of functions for exploratory panel data analysis. Run as a web-based app, 
    'ExPanD' enables users to assess the robustness of empirical evidence without 
    providing them access to the underlying data. You can also use the functions 
    of the package to support your exploratory data analysis workflow. Refer to 
    the vignettes of the package for more information on how to use 'ExPanD' 
    and/or the functions of this package.
